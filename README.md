# drupy

A multisite capable Drupal site-builder based on JSON-recipes.

## Features

-   Download and extract packages, prepare a Drupal tree and run "drush
    site-install" all from the same set of configuration files.
-   Package lists and site-configurations are pure JSON (ie. easy
    machine-generateable).
-   configuration files can "include" other json-files (even remote
    files).
-   Built-in support for multisite installations (optimized for sharing
    code in a manageable way).
-   Install files from: git repositores, tarballs, local directories,
    copy files, patches
-   Fast: if you change only one project (ie. add a patch) only this
    project is rebuilt.
-   Use hashes to check the integrity of downloaded files.

## Requirements

-   Python3
-   git
-   drush (for running site-install)
-   rsync
-   A symlink capable file-system

## FAQ

-   **Why not simply use drush make?** For our multi-site setup we'd
    like a directory structure that looks something like:
```
projects/  # packages
  module1-7.x-1.0/   # code of module1
  module1-7.x-2.1/   # another version of module1
  somesite/          # code of the custom somesite projects
  theproject/        # another custom project with a install_profile
htdocs/    # drupal-root
  profiles/
  theproject/ -> ../../projects/theproject
  minimal/
  standard/
  testing/

  sites/
    somesite/
    modules/         # symlinks to projects in the projects sub-folder
      contrib/       # only one copy of a module per version.
        module1 -> ../../../../../projects/module1-7.x-1.0
        …

    themes/
      contrib/
        theme1 -> ../../../../../projects/theme1-7.x-1.0
        …

  othersite/
    modules/
    contrib/         # allow different versions of a module per site
      module1 -> ../../../../../projects/module1-7.x-2.0
```
    Directory layouts like this seems rather cumbersome with drush make
    which seems to be a bit biased towards a one-drupal-tree-per-site
    approach of hosting.

-   **Why not use sites/all/ for code-sharing?** sites/all/ doesn't
    allow us to update modules site by site. If an module has an
    update-hook (ie. brings down your site until drush updb is run) you
    have to update the module-code. Then you need to run drush updb in
    all sites to bring them online again. So the mean down-time for a
    site is: n/2. With lots of sites this can take quite some time.

-   **Why care for code sharing at all?** Sharing the code for modules
    means that our opcode cache needs to hold only one copy of a file
    instead of one per site.
